Project Topic: In-pipe water monitoring system
Problem Statement: 
Currently the water monitoring and control is confronted with issues since worldwide large water utilities are undergoing losses due to leaks and burst pipes. Hence it is necessary to devise a system which can monitor the water systems for making the water consumption more efficient.
Solution Approach: An IOT solution for water monitoring and control aims at being able to gather data from multiple sensing devices such as flow, pressure, pH, pollution and contamination sensors.
System will analyze this data on timely basis and process it to give useful outputs to the water management company executives such as exact location of the leak. Also it will provide alerts to the executives if any major repairs are to be done for the leak.
In case of excessive water usage citizens will be notified to minimize the use.
Users Involved: 
Water management company executives, Citizens, maintenance agents
Key entities:
Several sensors, water pipes,
